		 Monitors interface state, input traffic, output traffic, input errors and output errors and notifies when anomalies are found.
		 Below are the inputs to control detection
		   1) interface-name-variable, is a regular expression that matches the
		      interfaces that you would like to monitor.  By default it's
		      '.*', which matches all interfaces. Use something like 'ge.*' to
		      match only gigabit ethernet interfaces.
		   2) out-octets-stats-name, is a regular expression that matches the interface KPI
		      statistics counter name that you would like to monitor. By default it's
		      out-octets, Use proper counter name something like 'out-pkts' or
		      "out-unicast-pkts" or "out-multicast-pkts" etc.
		   3) out-octets-high-threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
		      an anomaly.  By default it's 800000000 octets. This rule will set a
		      dashboard color to red when *all* the output traffic exceed threshold
		      for 600s. Use 8000000000 octets for 10G & 80000000000 for 100G interface.
		   4) out-octets-low-threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
		      an anomaly.  By default it's 500000000 octets . This rule will set a
		      dashboard color to yellow when *all* the output traffic exceed
		      threshold for 600s, otherwise color is set to green. Use 5000000000
		      octets for 10G & 50000000000 for 100G interface.
		   5) stats-name, is a regular expression that matches the interface KPI
		      statistics counter name that you would like to monitor. By default it's
		      in-octets, Use proper counter name something like 'in-pkts' or
		      "in-unicast-pkts" or "in-multicast-pkts" etc.
		   6) in-octets-high-threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to
		      report an anomaly.  By default it's 800000000 octets. This rule will
		      set a dashboard color to red when *all* the input traffic is above
		      threshold for 600 seconds period. Use 8000000000 octets for 10G &
		      80000000000 for 100G interface.
		   7) in-octets-low-threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to
		      report an anomaly.  By default it's 500000000 octets . This rule will
		      set a dashboard color to yellow when *all* the input traffic is above
		      threshold for 600 seconds period, otherwise color is set to green.
		      Use 5000000000 octets for 10G & 50000000000 for 100G interface.
		   8) in-errors-threshold-variable, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
		      an anomaly.  By default it's 1. This rule will set a dashboard
		      color to red when *all* the error increases are greater than
		      'in-errors-threshold-variable' for 600s. If it sees any errors increase for a
		      period of less than 600s, it'll turn the color to yellow,
		      otherwise color is set to green.
		   9) in-errors-stats-name, is the error stats counter name in-error which is
		      cumaulative of in-fram-errors, in-resource-errors, in-giants, in-drops,
		      in-discards and mtu-errors. Default value is in-errors.
		   10) out-errors-threshold-variable, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
		      an anomaly.  By default it's 1. This rule will set a dashboard
		      color to red when *all* the error increases are greater than
		      'out-errors-threshold-variable' for 600s. If it sees any errors increase for a
		      period of less than 600s, it'll turn the color to yellow,
		      otherwise color is set to green.
		   11) flaps-threshold-variable, is the threshold that causes the rule to report
		      an anomaly.  By default it's 1. This rule will set a dashboard
		      color to red when *all* the flap-increases are greater than
		      'flaps-threshold-variable' for 600s. If it sees any flaps increase for a
		      period of less than 600s, it'll turn the color to yellow,
		      otherwise color is set to green.
