# HealthBot System KPI rules and playbooks

## System playbooks
### Playbook name: system-additional-kpis 
		> Description: "To check system commit, OS file descriptors usage and sockets usage is within threshold."
		> Synopsis: "system key performance indicators"
		> Playbook file name: system-kpi.playbook
		> Detals:
		 Playbook contains multiple rules which checks the file descriptors and sockets
		 usage and notifies when anomalies are found.
		 1) Rule "check-file-descriptor-usage-netconf" monitors the file descriptor usage
		    and notifies anomalies when usage exceeds thresholds.
		 2) Rule "check-file-open-netconf" detects the count of number of open files and
		    is referenced by file descriptor usage rule.
		 3) Rule "check-socket-usage-netconf" monitors the file sockets usage and notifies
		    anomalies when usage exceeds thresholds.
		 4) Rule "check-sockets-open-netconf" detects the count of number of sockets and
		    is referenced by check-socket-usage rule .
		 5) Rule "commit-history" monitors the system commits and notifies anomalies.
		 6) Rule "check-inode-usage-netconf" monitors the system inode usage and notifies
		    anomalies when usage exceeds thresholds.

		 Detects System CPU & memory utilization and notifies when anomalies are found.
		 One input control detection
		
		   1) Threshold, is the threshold value for CPU and memory utiilzation takes as input and pass to the rule to
		      report an anomaly.  By default value is 80

		 Monitors commit history and notifies when anomalies are found.
		 Three inputs control detection
		   1) l1-commit-threshold, lowest threshold in minutes notifies the commit.
		       By default it monitors the commit in the last 5 minutes. If there is
		       any commits in the last 5 minutes, it'll turn the color to yellow.
		   2) l2-commit-threshold, lowest threshold in minutes notifies the commit.
		       By default it monitors the commit in the last 30 minutes. If there is
		       any commits in the last 30 minutes, it'll turn the color to yellow.
		   3) l3-commit-threshold, lowest threshold in minutes notifies the commit.
		       By default it monitors the commit in the last 60 minutes. If there is
		       any commits in the last 60 minutes, it'll turn the color to yellow.
		       if it's not matching above, it'll turn to green.
