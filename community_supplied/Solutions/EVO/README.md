### Playbook name: evo-route-summary-playbook 
		> Description: "Playbook checks each table's and protocol's route count and notifies anomaly when route count is above or below dynamic threshold"

		 protocol's router count and notifies when anomalies are found.
		 1) Rule "check-ascertain-routes" sets the dynamic thresholds based on
		    the learned data (route count of each table) using ML(Machine Learning)
		    algorithms and detects threshold breaches and notify anomalies.
		 2) Rule "check-protocol-route-coun" sets the dynamic thresholds based on
		    learned data (route count of each protocol) using ML(Machine Learning)
		    algorithms and detects threshold breaches and notify anomalies.

		 Detects system storage utilization threshold breaches and notifies when
		 anomalies are found.
		 Two inputs control detection
		
		   1) storage-usage-high-threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to
		      report an anomaly.  By default it's 80% of total size. This rule will
		      set a dashboard color to red when storage used exceed
		      'storage-usage-high-threshold'.
		
		   2) storage-usage-low-threshold, is the threshold that causes the rule to
		      report an anomaly. By default it's 50%. This rule will set a dashboard
		      color to green when storage used below 'storage-usage-low-threshold'.
		      otherwise color is set to yellow as used % is between 50% and 80%.
